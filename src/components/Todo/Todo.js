  You need to: 
  1. create the necessary React components: one for the overall application, one for displaying the list of to-dos, and one for adding new to-dos.
  2. set up state management for the to-do items. This could involve using React's useState hook to manage the list of to-dos.
  3. map through the list of to-dos and render them on the screen
  4. implement a feature that allows users to add new to-dos
  Optional:
  1. apply basic CSS to make the application look presentable
  2. write a simple test case (e.g. add a new todo and it should be displayed on the screen)
